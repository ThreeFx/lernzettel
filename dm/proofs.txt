Direkter Beweis einer Implikation S => T:

 - Assume S
 - Prove S => T

Indirect proof of an implication S => T:

 - Assume not T
 - Prove not T => not S

Reason: (not T -> not S) -> (S -> T) is a tautology.
So, not T -> not S |= S -> T

Composition of Implications: S => T and T => U:
If S => T and T => U, one concludes S => U

Reason: S -> T ^ T -> U |= S -> U

Modus ponens of S:

 - State R
 - State R => S
 - Prove both R and R -> S

Reason: A ^ (A -> B) |= B

Case Distinction of S:

 - State all cases R0 .. Rk
 - Prove that one case must occur
 - Also prove that forall i. Ri => S

Proof by Contradiction of S:

 - State T
 - Prove not S -> T
 - Prove not T

Reason: not T ^ (not S -> T) |= S

Existence Proof:

If there exists an a in U such that P(a) is true, then exists x. P(x) is true.

Pigeonhole principle:

Dividing n objects into k containers always implies that there exists one
container that must have at least `ceil (n / k)` objects.

Proof by Counterexample:

If there exists an a such that not P(a) is true, the statement
not forall x. P(x) is true. This is a special case of the existence proof.

Reason: exists x. not P(x) == not forall x. P(x)

Proof by Induction:

Prove P(0) (actually, it works for any fixed natural number a).
Prove forall n. P(n) -> P(n + 1).

Reason: P(0) ^ forall n. (P(n) -> P(n + 1)) |= forall n. P(n)

Proof that induction is correct using the well ordering principle:

We state a tautology:
F := (P(0) ^ forall n. (P(n) -> P(n + 1))) -> (forall n. P(n))

not F must be unsatisfiable.

not F == not (P(0) ^ forall n. (P(n) -> P(n + 1))) -> (forall n. P(n))
      == P(0) ^ forall n. (P(n) -> P(n + 1)) ^ not forall n. P(n)
         (1)             (2)                         (3)

(3) implies that there exists a smallest a such that P(a) is false.

From (1) and (2) we can follow P(a) by setting n = a - 1:

P(0) ^ .. ^ (P(a - 1) -> P(a))

So, we proved both `not F -> (P(a) and not P(a)) == not F -> false`, which proves
that not F is false. Therefore, F must be true.
